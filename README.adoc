= Postal

Command-line control and configuration for network communication.

The basic premise is to replace Postman with a command-line tool
that can be configured via toml scripts, environment variables,
and input parameters.

This tool can then be used to:

* automate testing against endpoints,
* simplify manual testing for endpoint developers
* share configurations via configuration files committed to SCM.
** you can pre-configure build vs. prod vs. test settings independently
   and concatenate them via the command line to compose your configuration
