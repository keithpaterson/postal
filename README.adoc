== Installation

You can install postal into your GOPATH from the command-line with
```
go install github.com/keithpaterson/postal/cmd/postal@latest
```

OR you can get the source using git clone and use the `./pkg` script to build
postal into the local `./bin` folder.

Start with 
```
./pkg --help
```

and go from there

== Objective

The basic premise is to replace Postman with a command-line tool
that can be configured via toml scripts, environment variables,
and input parameters.

This tool can then be used to:

* automate testing against endpoints,
* simplify manual testing for endpoint developers
* share configurations via files committed to SCM.
** you can pre-configure build vs. prod vs. test settings independently
   and concatenate them via the command line to compose your configuration
