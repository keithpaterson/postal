= Test Certificates and Root Authority

The files in this folder are only meant to be used for testing. The CA root is not intended to be certified or authorized for any
use except internal (unit) testing and aren't going to help you do anything outside that context.

== (re)generating test certificates:

See https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zma/2.1.0?topic=zvm-optional-creating-test-root-server-certificates

* `openssl genrsa -des3 -out testCA.key 2048`
+
_should already have been done_

* `openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key testCA.key -sha256 -days 1825 -out testCA.pem`
+
_generates the root certificate; valid for ~5 years (1825 days)_

If/when we end up regenerating this, the values (other than the passphrase) that were used in the questionnaire were:

** Country: `CA`
** Province: `Ontario`
** Locality: `Kitchener`
** Organization: `Postal Unit Tests Ltd`
** Org. Unit: `MFA`
** Common Name: `MFA Root Certificate`
** Email: `test@postal-unittest.io`

* `openssl genrsa -out unittest.key 2048`
+
_should already have been done: creates a new private key for making certificates_

* `openssl req -new -key unittest.key -out unittest.csr`
+
_creates a certificate signing request based on the certificate private key_

Use the same information we provided for the Root Certificate, except:

** Common Name: `Unit Test Certificate`
** Challenge Password: _left blank_
** Optional Company Name: _left blank_

- As per the IBM instructions, we created an extension file, but we did not bother to add
  `[alt_names]` for our certificate since this isn't being used for a web service (test or otherwise)

- `openssl x509 -req -in test-server.csr -CA myCA.pem -CAkey myCA.key -CAcreateserial -out test-server.pem -days 1825 -sha256 -extfile test-server.ext`
+
_generates the certificate using the CSR, CA private key, CA certificate, and the extension file_

== Summary of files:

=== Root Certificate

* `testCA.key`: Root certificate private key
* `testCA.pem`: Root certificate
* `testCA.srl`: Root certificate serial numbers (each new certificate is assigned a number which is stored here)

=== Unit Test Certificate

* `unittest.csr`: Test certificate signing request
* `unittest.ext`: Test certificate extensions
* `unittest.key`: Test certificate private key
* `unittest.pem`: Test certificate
