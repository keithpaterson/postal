/*
package resolver provides an implementation for resolving parameterized strings.

The resolver is used to convert tokens into actual values.  The resolver will
handle any token-recursion it encounters; so for example it can resolve a property
token that itself has an enviromment token:

---

	Config.Properties: {"foo": "${env:bar}"}
	environment: {"bar" = "hello"}
	Resolve("${prop:foo}") -> "hello"

---

Tokens are specified using '${type:value}' notation.

There are several supported token types, and the value specifcation depends on its type.
If Resolver cannot resolve the value of a token, then the token is left unchanged.
If "type" is omitted, then the resolver assumes a property token.
Therefore, "${prop: foo}" and "${foo}" are identical.

Resolver supports the following token types:

	"prop" : "value" is the name of a property found in the Config.Properties map.
			During resolution, the token is replaced with the value of the named property.
	"env"  : "value" is the name of an environment variable.
			During resolution, the token is replaced with the value of the environment variable.
	("date"|"time"|"datetime") : "value" specifies a date, time, or date+time expression.

	For date/time resolution, "value" is expressed using the format:
		"date[.(format)[ <+|-> delta<S>]]"
	Where:
		"date" is either the literal "now", or the date/time according to the "format" specification
		"format" is the date/time format specification; this is used to parse literal dates and also to stringfy the result.
			If not otherwise specified, the "RFC3339" format is used
		"[<+|-> delta<S>]" provides a means of adding or subtracting time from the "date":
			"<+|->" indicates addition or subraction.
				This is REQUIRED when expressing a time/date delta and must be either "+" or "-" (but not both).
			"delta" is an integer specifying the magnitude of the change
			"S" indicates the scope of the change, which must be one of the following case-sensitive values [YMWDhms],
			which correspond to Year, Month, Week, Day, hour, minute, and second respectively.

For Example:

Assuming the current date and time is Thursday July 6, 2025 3:45:21 pm, EST:

	"date:now" -> "2025-07-06"
	"time:now" -> "15:45:21Z"
	"datetime:now" -> "2025-07-06T15:45:21Z"
	"date:now(RFC850)" -> "Thursday, 06-Jul-25 15:45:21 EST"
	"date:now + 1Y" -> "2026-07-10"  (now plus one year)
	"date:now + 2M" -> "2025-09-06"  (now plus 2 months)
	"date:now - 4D" -> "2025-07-02"  (now less 4 days)
	"time:now + 3h" -> "18:45:21"    (now plus 3 hours)
	... and so on.

Format Specifiers:

Date/Time formats can be specified in three ways:

1. Using one of the Layout constants from the time package

2. Using the Layout value specification documented in time package

3. Using "YYYYMMDDhhmmss" date formatting strings, where:

	"Year", "YYYY", "YY"         : resolve to "2025", "2025", and "25" respectively
	"Month", "Mon", "MM", "_M"   : resolve to "July", "Jul", "07", and "7" respectively
	"Weekday", "Day", "DD", "_D" : resolve to "Thursday", "Thu", "06" and "6" respectively
	"HH", "hh" "_h"              : resolve to "15", "03" and "3" respetively (lowercase values indicate 12h notation)
	"mm", "ss"                   : resolve to "45", "21"
	"AM", "PM"                   : resolve to either "AM" or "PM", depending on the hour
	                               (typically only needed with 12h notation)
	"TimeZone", "TZ", "ZZ"       : resolve to "EST", "-0400", and "Z04:00" respectively
